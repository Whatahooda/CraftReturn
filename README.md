# ItemReturnOnCraft
A Minecraft plugin which by default returns empty bottles to the crafting interface in place of potions or xp bottles.
TODO: You will be able to edit a config file and add items that return other items to the crafting interface after a craft.

This plugin replicates the properties filled buckets in crafting recipes. Such as cake, the milk bucket is emptied and returned to the player.
