# CraftReturnsBottles
A Minecraft plugin which returns empty bottles to the crafting interface in place of potions or xp bottles.

This plugin replicates the properties filled buckets in crafting recipes. Such as cake, the milk bucket is emptied and returned to the player.
As there are not Vanilla recipes that include potions or xp bottles, this plugin is only useful to those who use custom recipes which include such.
