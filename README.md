# CraftReturn
A Minecraft plugin which by default returns empty bottles to the crafting interface in place of potions. As there are no recipes in Vanilla Minecraft with potions, this is currently only useful with custom recipes.
This plugin replicates the properties of filled buckets in crafting recipes. Such as cake, the milk bucket is emptied and returned to the player.
